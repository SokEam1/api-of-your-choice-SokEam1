# API of Your Choice
API of Your Choice is an extension of the Class of Your Choice assignment from Module 1. In this assignment, we'll be taking the class we made previously and creating an EntityFramework table that contains it, along with some API actions that allow our data to be accessed by other applications if needed. 

## Setup and Instructions
- Create a .NET API Application in Visual Studio.
- Setup EntityFramework using a DbContext file and Program.cs
- Create a new class, named the same as from the Class of Your Choice assignment, and then copy over the properties, constructor, and methods into this file.
- Implement GET (get all and get one), PUT, POST, DELETE on your class's API controller

## Grading
A Passing grade will be based on the following criteria:

- Your completed work has been pushed up to the GitHub Classroom repository before the deadline.
- You have all five required API actions
- Entity Framework is appropriately set up
